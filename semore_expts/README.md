## Task 1

Dataset 1: Dataset of pure fibrils vs pure iso (/w 10% noise) therefore have per FOV label

All configuration according to task_1/config

Note no features of the clusters are used in training

Bash scripts to run are located in task_1

## Task 2

Dataset 1: Dataset of pure fibrils vs pure iso (/w 10% noise) therefore have per FOV label

We used the preprocessed/feat extracted files from task 1 and the same splits for k-fold

Now however we use cluster features to make the classficiation
